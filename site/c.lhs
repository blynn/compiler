Let's descend from the realm of pure functions and step into the real world.

== Effectively ==

We add the IO monad and support FFI. The VM passes around a combinator `?` that
represents the real world. Reducing this combinator is a bug; it should always
be an argument to other combinators.

A value `x` of type `IO a` should behave as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
x w c --> c y w
------------------------------------------------------------------------

where `y` is some value of type `a`. In normal operation, `w` is the real-world
token `?`, and the continuation `c` should expect two arguments but never
reduce the second one.

We add a crude syntax for FFI, with crude code for generating the requisite C
wrappers. An `F` combinator invokes these foreign functions.

function hideshow(s) {
  var x = document.getElementById(s);
  if (x.style.display === "none") {
    x.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    x.style.display = "none";
  }
}
</script>

<div id='effectively' style='display:none'>

Rather than a bunch of numbers, our compiler generates C code that should be
appended to the following C implementation of the VM:

We employ a stop-the-world copying garbage collector. It turns out we should
reduce projection functions (such as `fst` and `snd`) as we collect garbage.
See:

Hughes 1983, 'The design and implementation of programming languages']
  * https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/leak/leak.ps.gz[Philip Wadler 1987, 'Fixing some space leaks with a garbage collector']

We partially achieve this by reducing `K I T` nodes during garbage collection.

Eliminating applications of `I` during garbage collection makes up for not
doing so during evaluation.

Our simple design means the only garbage collection root we need is the top of
the stack.

We've made it to the real world. Our next compiler has a main function of type
`IO ()`, and calls `getchar()` and `putchar()` via FFI. Running `effectively`
on this compiler produces C source. Appending this to `rts.c` and compiling
yields a standalone compiler. This contrasts with our previous compilers, which
require a program that understands ION assembly or a bunch of integers
representing VM memory contents.

We also add support for `if` expressions and infix patterns in case expressions.
